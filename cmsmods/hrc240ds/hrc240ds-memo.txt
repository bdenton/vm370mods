Description:
============

This update extends the "ALternate Nucleus" support added by HRC075DK
by allowing the alternate nucleus to be defined on any system-owned
volume, of any device type, and at any cylinder location.  The intent
of this update is to completely separate the definition of any alternate
nucleui from the definition contained on the SYSRES macro.

This update further extends HRC075DK by inlcuding alternate nucleus 
support for the DDR COPY NUCLEUS command. DDR can now copy the nucleus
from between alternate nucleus locations. The only requirement is that 
the target volume must have had a nucleus written to it as some point.
This is because the nucleus location on a volume is recorded in the
first page of DMKCKP which is record 0/0/2 on the volume.

For completeness, this update also adds the QUERY NUCLEUS command which
lists details of each alternate nucleus defined for the current system.

Details:
========

ALTNUC MACRO (new)
------------
This is a new macro that is used to define the alternate nucleui details
in DMKSYS. (The first nucleus is still defined by the SYSRES macro.)
One ALTNUC macro statement must be included for each alternate nucleus.
The format of these statements is:

         ALTNUC VOLSER=volser[,DEVTYPE=type],&CYLS=beg | (beg,cnt)
         
where:
   
   VOLSER   The volume serial number of the disk volume containing the
            alternate nucleus. This must be a volume listed in the SYSOWN
            macro statement. It cannot match the SYSRES SYSVOL= parameter
            nor the VOLSER on any other ALTNUC macro statement.
             
   DEVTYPE  (optional) specifies the device type of the volume containing
            the alternate nucleus. Defaults to the SYSRES device type,
            Values: 2305 | 2314 | 2319
                    3330 | 3333 | 3340
                    3350 | 3375 | 3380
                    
   CYLS     specifies the locaation of the alternate nucleus on the volume
            This parameter can take two forms:
            
            CYLS=beg       specfies the starting cylinder location. The
                           default space of two (2) cylinders will be
                           allocated for the alternate nucleus. This is
                           usually sufficient for a CP nucleus without
                           any V=R area.
                           
            CYLS=(beg,cnt) specifies the starting cylinder location and
                           the number of cylinders of the alternate nucleus
                           on the volume. (The current CP nucleus with an
                           8MB V=R area taakes about 19 3350 cylinders.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PSA MACRO
---------

Fields in the PSA are modified as follows:

* SYSIPLDV - comments are modified to indicate that this field is the
             default device for checkpoint, warm start, and error
             recording.

* INSTWRD2 - this is replaced with the following two fields:

             PSAIPLDV - the actual IPL device holding the alternate
                         nucleus
             PSANUCAD - the starting cylinder location of the
                        alternate nucleus

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSLOCS MACRO
-------------

Adds logic to generate a new table DMKSYSNT (Nucleus Table) that
contains the volser, device type,  and cylinder location of all
IPLable nucleus images defined by the SYSRES and ALTNUC macros.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSRES MACRO
------------

Save nucleus volser and cylinder location in GBLx variables for all nucleus
definitions from the SYSRES and ALTNUC macro statements so that they can be 
included in the nucleus location table that will be built in SYSLOCS.

Also enhance SYSRES macro to allow specification of the number of cylinders 
allocated to the nucleus (extension to HRC102DK).

Removes the now obsolete DMKSYSNU entry point.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMKCFC ASSEMBLE
---------------

This updates adds the new HDKCQN query module and adds the   
QUERY NUCLEUS command to report on nucleus configs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMKCKP ASSEMBLE
---------------

1) Changes the logic that reads the second page of DMKCKP to read from the 
   IPL volume rather than the configured SYSRES
   
2) Changes the logic that reads in DMKSAV to read from the IPL volume 
   instead of SYSRES
   
3) Adds a new entry point (DMKCKPCD) that contains the date/time the 
   nucleus was written to the volume

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMKCPI ASSEMBLE
---------------

!!!! NOTE !!!!
     Entry conditions from DMKSAVRS have changed to include the 
     starting sylinder location of the IPLed nucleus in the 
     high-order 2 bytes of R10

Most of the changes relate to the fact that the IPL device might 
not be the SYSRES device.

1) Save IPL device address in PSA as well as the SYSRES device. 
   Neither of them is based on a configured device address.
   The actual device address is determined by scanning the 
   RDEVBLOKs for the matching VOLSER
   
2) Change SWPTABLE build so nucleus pages are taken from the IPL 
   device and cylinder rance rather than using the values from 
   the SYSRES macro.

Note: All SYSRES values except nucleus location will still be used 
      and processed against the SYSRES volume or other location as 
      per HRC075DK.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMKDDR ASSEMBLE
---------------

This makes the following changes to NUCLEUS operations performed 
with DASD as an output target.

1) No longer validate that the input and output VOLSERs match.

2) If the output volume already has a nucleus on it, then write 
   the new nucleus to that location if it will fit.

In order to have DDR write a nucleus to location other than the 
location of the input nucleus, the output volume must have 
previously had a nucleus weitten to it by DMKSAV.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMKDMP ASSEMBLE
---------------

Differentiate between the SYSRES and IPL volumes
   -- SYSRES is used by checkpointing logic
   -- IPL volume is used by warm start logic

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMKSAV ASSEMBLE
---------------

!!!! NOTE !!!!
     Entry conditions from DMKSAVRS to DMKCPINT have changed 
     to include the starting sylinder of the IPLed nucleus 
     in the high-order 2 bytes of R10  
     
Writes the nucleus to the DMKSYSRS device address. The device 
type and cylinder range are determined by looking up the 
device's volid in the DMKSYSNT table.

Reads the nucleus from the IPL device. The device type and 
cylinder range are fouind by looking up the IPL volid in 
the DMKSYSNT table.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMKSYS ASSEMBLE
---------------

The default VM/370 Community Edition Version 1 Release 1.3 is modified
to include an ALTNUC macro statement to define the existing alternate
nucleus on VM50-2

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HDKCQA ASSEMBLE
---------------

Remove reference to obsolete SYSRES member DMKSYSNU   

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HDKCQN ASSEMBLE  (new)
---------------

Adds a new query extensions module to contain the new QUERY NUCLEUS command.                   
This started out being added to HDKCQA but got too large.

Command:
     
     Query NUCleus
     
Output:     

     CP NUCLEUS LOCATIONS
     VOLSER UNIT TYPE   RANGE   CREATE DATE/TIME
     VM50-1 6A1* 3350 0530-0548 mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss
     VM50-2 6A2  3350 0530-0548 mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss
     * = Currently IPLed nucleus
