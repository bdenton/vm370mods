Add new IOS entry point for synchronous I/O

Prerequisites:

None

Description:
============

This update adds a new entry point to DMKIOS to provide a
simpler way of performing an I/O operation. 

Using this new entry point allows the caller to avoid having 
to implement a second-level interrupt handler (SLIH) to 
handle the completion of the I/O event. Instead, the I/O 
operation results can be processed in a linear fashinn 
right after calling the new DMKIOSRQ entry point.

It is intended that this new entry point be used when 
there really isn't anything for a device to do until
the results of an I/O operation are processed.

DMKIOS ASSEMBLE
---------------

The new DMKIOS entry point propcesses the I/O request:  

   1. For AP support, SWITCH to the I/O processor
   2. Save R13 current save area address in IOBMISC
   3. Set the IOBIRA to our local completion routine
   4. Call DMKIOSQR to perform the I/O 
   5. Go to the dispatcher to await completion
   
The local completion routine (#3 above) is entered
when the I/O request is finished. It will:

   1. Reestablish DMKIOS addressability
   2. Restore R13 save area address from IOBMISC
   3. Join common DMKIOS return logic at IOSQXIT
