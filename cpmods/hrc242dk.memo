LOCAL MODIFICATION: HRC242DK

Add option to bypass error recording/recovery

Affected Files:

IOBLOKS  COPY 
DMKIOS   ASSEMBLE

Prerequisites:

Description:
============

Sometimes CP needs to perform an I/O operation that could produce 
"expected" results.. For instance, the 3270 code might want to 
issue a Write-Structured-Field but, if it isn't supported, 
just continue on without the optional features and without any 
error messages or recovery processing.

Details:
========

IOBLOKS COPY          
------------ 

This update adds two new flags to IOBSPEC3:
   -- IOBBYPER - Bypass ERP for errors (set by caller))
   -- IOBHADER - Task resulted in bypassed error  (set by IOS)

This update also redefines one of the "reserved"
bytes (IOBRSV2) to pass back the "ignored" sense data
   -- IOBFSNS1 - first byte of ignored sense data    

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DMKIOS ASSEMBLE
---------------

Allow device support to issue a CCW that might or might
not result in some sort of device error and have the 
standard error reporting and recovery by bypassed and
the error condition just returned to the caller.

When this option is enabled (IOBSPEC3+IOBBYPER), DMKIOS
will just return the result in the IOBLOK being stacked to
dispatcher for return to the IOBIRA address. In this case,
the new IOBHADER flag will also be set anad the first byte
of any sense data placed in IOBFSNS1 so the device support
can take aaction like fencing off an optional feature.
